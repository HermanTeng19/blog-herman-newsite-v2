- **Quality Metrics**: Accuracy, completeness, and depth of outputs
- **Research Efficiency**: Sources analyzed per hour
- **Creative Output**: Ideas generated and implemented
- **Decision Speed**: Time from research to decision

### ROI Calculation Framework

```python
def calculate_productivity_roi(baseline_time, ai_assisted_time, quality_improvement):
    """
    Calculate ROI of AI-assisted productivity
    """
    time_saved = baseline_time - ai_assisted_time
    efficiency_gain = (time_saved / baseline_time) * 100
    
    # Factor in quality improvement
    adjusted_gain = efficiency_gain * (1 + quality_improvement)
    
    return {
        'time_saved_hours': time_saved,
        'efficiency_percentage': efficiency_gain,
        'quality_adjusted_gain': adjusted_gain
    }

# Example calculation
roi = calculate_productivity_roi(
    baseline_time=8,  # hours
    ai_assisted_time=3,  # hours
    quality_improvement=0.25  # 25% quality boost
)
```
